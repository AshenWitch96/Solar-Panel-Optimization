# ⚡ Solar Panel Optimization

This project uses a machine learning model to analyze and optimize the performance of solar panels based on various input parameters.

## 📂 Project Files

- `Code.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the entire workflow — including data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: Project overview and usage instructions.

## 📌 Features

- Predicts solar panel efficiency using regression models
- Analyzes input features such as irradiance, temperature, and panel angle
- Achieves efficiency score of **89.88%**

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn, LightGBM

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open `Code.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
2. Run the cells in sequence to reproduce results

> 📎 No external datasets required if already embedded in the notebook.
